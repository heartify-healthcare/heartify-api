# This file would normally contain the SQLAlchemy models for the prediction module
# Since we're not implementing database functionality at this stage, we'll leave it empty

# For future reference, you might add models like:
# - PredictionRecord: to store predictions made
# - ModelMetadata: to store information about the deployed ML model
